This is a Kotlin app used to save your workouts. For back-end, .NET Web Api is used.


To test the app locally:
1. Go to https://github.com/YuTaral/FitnessAppAPI to setup the server side API
2. Download the Repo and open with Android Studio
3. Create "local.properties" file in the root folder if it's missing
4. Open "local.properties" and add DEV_BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.0:1111/api/, 
   where "http://192.168.0.0:1111/api/" the "192.168.0.0" and "1111" should be replaced by the value set in the API (In launchesttings.Json -> profiles -> http -> set applicationUrl)

Both frond-end and back-end apps still in development.
